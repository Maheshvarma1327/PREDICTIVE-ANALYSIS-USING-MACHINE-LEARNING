DOMAIN: DATA ANALYSIS

DURATION: 6 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

📌 Project Title:
Predictive Analysis Using Random Forest Classification: A Feature-Driven Approach with Scikit-Learn

📁 Internship Task:
CodTech Internship – Task 2

Build a predictive machine learning model using classification or regression, demonstrate feature selection, model training, and evaluation in a Jupyter Notebook.

🎯 Objective:
The goal of this project is to:

Load and explore a structured dataset

Perform feature selection

Build a Random Forest Classifier model

Evaluate the model using multiple metrics

Visualize key insights including feature importance and confusion matrix

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

📊 Dataset:
Dataset: retail_data.csv

Type: Tabular data with categorical and/or numerical features

Task: Classification (adjusted based on the actual target column)

Ensure the CSV file is placed in the same directory as the notebook.

📌 Features of the Project:
Clean modular code structure

Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Standard scaling of input features

Random Forest Model Training

Cross-validation accuracy score

Evaluation using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix

Feature Importance

Data visualizations

🔍 How to Use:
Clone the repository or download the project files.

Place your dataset retail_data.csv in the same directory.

Open the Task2_ML_Predictive_Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.

Run the notebook cell-by-cell.

Review the evaluation metrics and graphs.

✅ Output:
Model accuracy and confusion matrix

Feature importance ranking

Cross-validation score

Final predictions for test data

📌 Example Results:
Accuracy: ~92.3%

Top Features: Age, Purchase Value, Product Category, etc.
(Based on dataset contents)
